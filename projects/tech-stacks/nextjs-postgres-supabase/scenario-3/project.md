You are a full-stack developer at WorkPulse Inc., an HR software company. You're developing a time tracking system where employees clock in/out, log their work hours, and request time off. Managers need a dashboard to view team attendance, approve time-off requests, and generate payroll reports. Your task is to build the manager dashboard that aggregates employee time data from the backend and displays it in a meaningful, actionable format. (No need to make authentication and login as manager or employee, simply make the manager side.)
